# Decentralized Agricultural Equipment Sharing

This project implements a blockchain-based system for agricultural equipment sharing among farmers. The platform enables farmers to share high-cost machinery, reducing capital expenses while ensuring fair access, proper maintenance, and transparent usage tracking.

## Core Components

1. **Equipment Registration Contract**
    - Records detailed information about shared farm machinery
    - Creates digital representation of equipment with specifications and capabilities
    - Tracks equipment availability, condition, and location
    - Maintains immutable history of equipment usage and performance

2. **Farmer Verification Contract**
    - Validates legitimate agricultural operators for system participation
    - Creates secure digital identities for participating farmers
    - Establishes reputation metrics based on equipment usage history
    - Ensures compliance with local agricultural regulations

3. **Reservation Management Contract**
    - Handles scheduling and allocation of equipment resources
    - Implements fair access protocols during peak demand periods
    - Tracks actual usage hours and conditions
    - Creates transparent record of equipment utilization

4. **Maintenance Fund Contract**
    - Manages shared costs for equipment upkeep and repairs
    - Automatically allocates maintenance fees based on usage
    - Tracks maintenance history and scheduled service requirements
    - Handles disbursement to service providers and parts suppliers
